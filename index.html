    <h2>Introduction to Oceans</h2>
    <p>
      Oceans cover more than 70% of the Earth's surface. They are vital to maintaining the balance of life on our planet, regulating climate, and providing resources. The five major oceans—Pacific, Atlantic, Indian, Southern, and Arctic—each hold unique features and mysteries.

    <h3>Ocean Zones</h3>
    <p>
      The ocean is divided into zones based on depth: the sunlight zone, twilight zone, midnight zone, and the abyss. These zones vary in temperature, light, and pressure, making each one uniquely suited for different forms of marine life.
